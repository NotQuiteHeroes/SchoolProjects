# Foundations of Software Design

This was an introductory class that only implemented pseudocode for various algorithms, such as searching, sorting, and mathematical
operations.

Some of the pseudocode was provided by the professor as a skeleton. 

I went through later and wrote the pseudocode examples into Python. I tried to keep the Python versions as faithful to the 
pseudocode as possible.

## Basic Address Book
*Note: this works with Python version 3.x

An ongoing project in the course was to add various components to an address book skeleton. It started with simply being able
to add contacts. Additions of searching were eventually implemented, as is shown in this version.

## Address Book With Password
*Note: This works with Python version 3.x

This version of the address book adds a password that is required to be input at the beginning of each run, as well as functionality
to save information to a file and load information from file at beginning of each run.

### Usage:
python addressBookWithPassword.py

#### Adding a new contact:

## Calculator
*Note: This program works with Python version 2.7

This is a basic calculator that can take any number of operands and add, subtract, multiply, or divide them, as well as perform exponential math. It can also save any results to memory, use the number in memory in its operations, print the number in memory, and clear it. 

### Usage:
python2.7 calculator.py

## Exponential Calculator
*Note: This program works with Python 3.x

This is a simple program to perform exponential math given two integers by the user.

### Usage:
python exponentialCalculator.py

## Magic 8 Ball
*Note: This program works with Python 3.x

This program takes nine questions, one at a time, from the user and responds with the standard Magic 8 Ball answers. The program will end once all nine answers have been displayed.

### Usage:
python magic8ball.py

## Measurement Converter
*Note: this program works with Python 3.x

This program inputs a number of cups from the user and returns its converted amount in Gallons, Quarts, Pints, Tablespoons, and Teaspoons.

### Usage:
python measurementconverter.py
