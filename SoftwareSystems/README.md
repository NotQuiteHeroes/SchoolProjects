# Software Systems Principles
The main focus of this class was the history, development, and creation of programming languages. There were a few programming assignments that focused on exception handling, memory access times, and sorting algorithms.

## Exception
This program illustrates implementing exception handling to check a range of numbers input by the user. The program asks the user to enter any amount of inters, one at a time, entering * when they are done inputting. If any of the numbers input are greater than 100, or less than -100, then the program will throw an exception. If the numbers are in the accepted range, then they will be squared individually and added together to display the sum.

### Compilation:
g++ exception.cpp

### Execution:
a.exe

## Memory Times
This program illustrates the time taken to declare and initialize an array of 100,000 elements statically, on the stack, and on the heap.

### Compilation:
g++ memoryTimes.cpp

### Execution:
a.exe

## Quick Sort
This program implements two versions of the Quick Sort algorithm - one recursive, and one iterative. 

### Compilation:
g++ quickSort.cpp

### Execution:
a.exe
