# Simulation Analysis and Design

Collection of assignments from Simulation Analysis and Design class. The main focus of the class was discussing different simulation methods, and implementing simple Monte Carlo simulations in both Excel and C++. 

## Coin Toss

This program acts as a Monte Carlo simulation of tossing a coin. Full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Simulation%20Analysis%20and%20Design/CoinToss/README.md).

## ROI Code

This program acts as a Monte Carlo simulation of return on investment over a given period of time. Full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Simulation%20Analysis%20and%20Design/ROICode/README.md).

## Traffic

This program was the final project of the course. It is a Monte Carlo simulation of a traffic flow algorithm that implements a simple random walk solution. Full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Simulation%20Analysis%20and%20Design/Traffic/README.md).
