# Binary Search Tree

Implements a Binary Search Tree to sort an address book in alphabetical order by last name. The address book contacts are hard
coded for testing purposes in bst.cpp.

Uses a struct Node to hold contact information as well as pointers to neighboring nodes. The Tree class handles the actual insertion, 
deletion, and sorting functions.

### Input 
Input of contacts is done in bst.cpp in the form insert("lastName_firstName", "(555)-555-5555", "City, State")

### Output
All contacts of address book sorted in alphabetical order by last name.
