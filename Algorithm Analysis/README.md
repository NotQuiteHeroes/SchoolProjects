# Algorithm Analysis

Collection of assignments from Algorithm Analysis class. The focus of this class was various searching and sorting algorithms, as well
as algorithms to work on graphs.

## Binary Search
Basic Binary Search with a hardcoded array of numbers to be used in testing. 

### Compilation:
javac BinarySearch.java

### Usage:

## Name Match
Name Match uses regex to determine if a string is a name. String is hardcoded to be used in testing.

### Compilation:
javac NameMatch.java

### Usage:

## Binary Search Symbol Tree
Binary Search ST illustrates a symbol table implemented with a binary search tree. Full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Algorithm%20Analysis/BinarySearchSymbolTable/README.md).

## Edge Weighted Graph
Represents an edge weighted graph and prints information pertaining to graph, such as total vertices, edges, and adjacency lists. Full
readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Algorithm%20Analysis/EdgeWeightedGraph/README.md).

### Usage:

## Graph
Represents an undirected graph and holds information on the graph, such as vertices and edges as well as adjacency lists. Full
read me can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Algorithm%20Analysis/Graph/README.md).

### Usage:

## Knitting Translator
Project for Algorithm Analysis. Has two versions, a full command line with menu options for the user, or a simplified command line
version where the term(s) to be translated are entered as a command line argument. Takes in German term(s) and returns the
English translations. Full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Algorithm%20Analysis/KnittingTranslator/README.md).

### Usage:

## LSD
Least-Significant-Digit string sort. Inputs equal-length words from text file and outputs them in alphabetical order.
Full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Algorithm%20Analysis/LSDSort/README.md).

### Usage:

## MSD
Most-significant-Digit string sort. Inputs any length words from text file and outputs them in alphabetical order. Full readme
can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Algorithm%20Analysis/MSDSort/README.md).
