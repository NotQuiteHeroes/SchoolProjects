The full command line version of the Knitting Translator offers a three item menu. 1. Offers the option to translate German term(s) into English. 2. Offers the ability to add a term to the dictionary. 3. Offers the option to exit the program.
Upon translating a text through option 1, the program will ask if the user wants to save the translation. If they enter "yes", the translation will be saved to a .txt file.
