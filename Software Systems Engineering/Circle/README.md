# Circle

This program takes the center coordinates of a circle in x,y format, as well as the radius of the circle. It then calculates and displays the circumference and area of the circle. 

## Files:
+ Point.h/.cpp : Class to implement a single point on a coordinate plane. Requires x and y coordinates. 
+ Circle.h/.cpp : Class that inherits from Point. Holds circle information, such as center, radius, and all calculations for the circle's circumference and area. 
+ circleTest.cpp : Testfile for Circle class. Circle objects are hardcoded here for testing purposes. 

## Compilation:
g++ Point.cpp Circle.cpp circleTest.cpp

## Execution:
