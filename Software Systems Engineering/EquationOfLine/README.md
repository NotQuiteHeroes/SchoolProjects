# Equation of Line

This program creates two points on the coordinate plane in the x,y format. It then prints the coordinates, as well as the equation of the line using the two points in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) and the standard form (Ax + By = C). 

## Files:
+ Point.h/.cpp : Class that contains single coordinate point information in format (x, y).
+ Line.h/.cpp : Class that handles line equations. Contains methods to calculate both forms of line equation, as well as methods to print in standard fraction form, rather than decimal format. 
+ PointandLineTest.cpp : testfile with hardcoded Point and Line objects. Displays information once calculations are complete.

## Compilation:
g++ Point.cpp Line.cpp PointandLineTest.cpp

## Execution:
a.exe
