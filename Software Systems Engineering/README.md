# Software Systems Engineering

Collection of assignments from Software Systems Engineering. The main focus of this class was going through the process of developing a project from a software management position. This included discussing design patterns, creating schedules, dispersing tasks, holding meetings to discuss progress, and delivering a final product.

## Circle

This program illustrates simple inheritance. It takes a circle's information from the user, including its center point and radius. It then calculates and displays the circle's area and circumference. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/Circle/README.md).

## Date

This program takes a date in any standard format, verifies it is a valid date, then calculates what day of the year it falls on (1 - 365). It takes into account leap years. If an invalid date format is entered, it requests a valid format from the user. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/Date/README.md).

## Employee

This program creates an Employee object given a first name, last name, and salary. It contains methods to modify any of these fields. It illustrates creating an object then modifying the object's salary. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/Employee/README.md).

## Equation of a Line

This program creates two Point objects, given x and y coordinates by the user. It then calculates the slope-intercept equation of the line given the two points, as well as the standard equation of a line using the two points. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/EquationOfLine/README.md).

## Personal Library
This program acts as a tracker for a personal library. It keeps member information, such as an id number, first name, last name, and a library of books owned. It can add books to the library, update member information, display library information (such as newest/oldest book, and least/most expensive book) as well as print the entire contents of the library. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/PersonalLibrary/README.md).

### Usage

## Roman
This program takes a Roman Numeral as a string from the user, converts it to its integer form, then displays the results. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/Roman/README.md).

### Usage:

## Television
This program illustrates basic exception handling. It creates a Television object given a model number, screen size, and price by the user. If these fields don't match the given requirements, then all are set to 0 and a message is displayed to the user. A full readme can be found [here](https://github.com/NotQuiteHeroes/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Software%20Systems%20Engineering/Television/README.md).

### Usage
#### Without Exception:

#### With Exception:

## Reverse Number
This program takes a number from the user, reverses it, then displays the results. It can be run as a full command line version, asking the user to enter a number, or it can be used as a quick command line program, with the number given as a command line argument.

### Compilation:
g++ reverseNum.cpp

### Execution:
a.exe
or
a.exe 123
