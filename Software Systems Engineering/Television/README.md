# Television

The purpose of this program is to implement exception handling. It creates a Television object given a screen size, model number, and price. If the model number is more than four digits, the screen size is greater than 70 or less than 12, or the price is more than 5,000 then all fields will be set to 0 and a message will be displayed with what the specific error is.
