# Roman Numeral

This program takes a Roman Numeral as a string, stores it, converts it to its integer form, stores it, and can print either form upon user request. It assumes the Roman Numeral input by the user is in correct format.

Note, Roman Numerals are hardcoded in the testfile, RomanTest.cpp, for testing purposes.

## Compilation:
g++ Roman.cpp RomanTest.cpp
